# Hand-written-digit-recoginition

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from images. The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model, which achieves high accuracy. Uploaded digit images are preprocessed using OpenCV (grayscale, resize, blur, and threshold). The model predicts the digit, and the result is displayed with matplotlib. It runs in a loop to continuously accept and classify user-uploaded digit images.
